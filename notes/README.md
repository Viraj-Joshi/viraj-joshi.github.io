# some tutorials

I often like to write down in my own words topics in ML that I have spent significant time learning about. Instead of keeping it on paper, I thought I might as well write it out on the internet, forcing me to distill and clarify my own understanding.

## resources

Some great resources I've come across
- transformers: https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/
- diffusion and flow monograph: https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2510.21890
- flow models: https://d2jud02ci9yv69.cloudfront.net/2025-04-28-flow-with-what-you-know-38/blog/flow-with-what-you-know/

## Planned Table of Contents
- Reinforcement Learning
    - Offline RL
    - RL for LLMs
    - Successor Representations
- Diffusion/Flow
    - Score Matching
    - Diffusion Models as Score Matching with Langevin Dynamics
    - Diffusion Models from denoising probablistic models
    - Flow Matching and Diffusion from ODEs
